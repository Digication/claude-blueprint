## Instructions

Review the current conversation for potential workflow improvements.

## Check For

1. **Skill corrections** - A skill was used but needed adjustment
   -> Follow [SKILL_IMPROVEMENT](references/SKILL_IMPROVEMENT.md)

2. **General preferences** - User expressed cross-cutting preferences
   -> Follow [GENERAL_IMPROVEMENT](references/GENERAL_IMPROVEMENT.md)

3. **New skill opportunity** - No skill existed but approach worked well
   -> Follow [SKILL_CREATION](references/SKILL_CREATION.md)

## Examples

### After a Correction (Skill Improvement)

```
User: /commit
Agent: [creates commit with emoji in message]
User: No, I don't want emojis in commit messages
Agent: [fixes it]
User: /retrospective
Agent: I noticed a potential improvement to the `/commit` skill:
       **No emojis**: You prefer commits without emojis.
       Should I update the skill?
```

### After Expressing a Preference (General Improvement)

```
User: Install the new lodash-es package
Agent: [runs npm install lodash-es]
User: No, we use pnpm in this project, not npm
User: /retrospective
Agent: I noticed a general preference:
       **Package manager**: This project uses pnpm, not npm.
       I'll save this to CLAUDE.md.
```

### After a Successful New Workflow (Skill Creation)

```
User: Check the status of PRs #421, #425, and #430
Agent: [launches parallel gh api calls]
Agent: PR #421: all passed ...
User: Perfect, that was fast
User: /retrospective
Agent: I didn't have a skill for batch PR status checks. The approach worked:
       1. Parse PR numbers from request
       2. Fetch check runs in parallel
       3. Aggregate and summarize results
       Save as a new skill?
```
